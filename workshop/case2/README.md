# Case 2: Hello, Java!

## About the case

This case uses the native java_binary and java_library rules. 
The java_library rule compiles and links sources into a .jar file 
The java_binary rule builds a jar file, plus a wrapper shell script.
See bazel-bin/workshop/case2/hello.runfiles/_main/workshop/case2/hello for the wrapper script.


## Additional things to try out
### Query Bazel for the dependency graph of the hello target:
`bazel query "deps(//workshop/case2:hello)"`

vs

`bazel query "deps('//workshop/case2:hello') intersect //..."`

### Show files generated by a target:
`bazel cquery //workshop/case2:hello --output=files`

### Create another library and consume it in the `hello` target
